# CSGO-Memory-Vision-Cheat
A (very alpha but working) prototype for a memory reading cheat program which reads data from an external 3D program and forces a GDI window to display a UI, the code is designed primarily with avoiding an anti-cheat as it's main influence.

This app requires a server or removal of user authentication and csgo memory references in order to run. This project is outdated and no longer in development, this is hosted for reference only.
